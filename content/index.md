# Hello, world

My name is Liam and I make things for the web. I live in Yorkshire and love hackable hardware, open source software, generative art, and music theory.

I work as a Staff Specialist Engineer at AKQA Leap (formerly Potato), and have built sites and apps for the likes of Google, Mozilla, and RBS.
