# Hello, world

My name is Liam and I make things for the web. I live in Yorkshire and love hackable hardware, open source software, generative art, and music theory.

I work for a company called [Potato](https://p.ota.to) as a full-stack developer, and build Django apps for the likes of Google, Mozilla and RBS.
