Hello, world ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my humans.txt.

I like coding things! If youâ€™re interested in this site and how itâ€™s made, you
can find the source for it on GitHub:

I also love talking with like-minded tech folk. Letâ€™s be friends! You can find
me as @liam@nwmr.ch on Mastodon and liamnewmarch on most other social media.

Have a good one ðŸŒ±
