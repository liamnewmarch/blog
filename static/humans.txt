Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my humans.txt.

I like coding things! If youâ€™re interested in this site and how itâ€™s made, you
can find the source for it on GitHub:

    https://github.com/liamnewmarch/liam.nwmr.ch

I also love talking with like-minded tech folk. Lets be friends! You can find
me on most social media as liamnewmarch, and as @liamnewmarch@mastodon.social
on Mastodon.

Have a good one ðŸŒ±
