Hello, world ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my humans.txt.

I like coding things! If youâ€™re interested in this site and how itâ€™s made, you
can find the source for it on GitHub:

I love talking with like-minded tech folk, so letâ€™s be friends! You can find
me at @liam.nwmr.ch on Bluesky and @liam@nwmr.ch on Mastodon.

Have a good one! ðŸŒ±
